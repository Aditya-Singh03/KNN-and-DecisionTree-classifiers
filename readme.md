## How to run this program (its very simple and concise)<br>
**Just type**
>`python knnAndDt.py`

in the terminal and you will be able to run both the models and create the their plots in one go. All the plots will also get saved in this very same folder. (Just make sure that when you try to run this file, you are in the same folder as the file's parent folder)

(If `python knnAndDt.py` does not work, then try `python3 knnAndDt.py`)
